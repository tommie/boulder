-- This file defines the default users for the primary database, used by
-- all the parts of Boulder except the Certificate Authority module, which
-- utilizes its own database.

-- Create users for each component with the appropriate permissions. We want to
-- drop each user and recreate them, but if the user doesn't already exist, the
-- drop command will fail. So we grant the dummy `USAGE` privilege to make sure
-- the user exists and then drop the user.

SET SESSION sql_mode = 'NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';

-- Policy loader, CA, RA
-- Note: The same config section, "pa" is used by the policy loader (for writes)
-- and the CA and RA (for reads). So right now we have the one user that has
-- both read and write permission, even though it would be better to give only
-- read permission to CA and RA.
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE ON blacklist TO 'policy'@'%';
